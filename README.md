Your first major task is a research project on employees of the corporation from the 1980s and 1990s. All that remain of the database of employees from that period are six CSV files. In this assignment, you will design the tables to hold data in the CSVs, import the CSVs into a SQL database, and answer questions about the data. In other words, you will perform:   Data Engineering   Data Analysis   Note: You may hear the term "Data Modelling" in place of "Data Engineering," but they are the same terms. Data Engineering is the more modern wording instead of Data Modelling.  Before You Begin   Create a new repository for this project called sql-challenge.
